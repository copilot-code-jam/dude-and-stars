## How Copilot was used

Copilot was used extensively throughout the development of **Dude and Stars**. Here are some specific ways it contributed:

1. **Inline Suggestions**: Copilot provided inline suggestions to replace the logo with the game name "Dude and Stars".
2. **Chat Commands**: Using chat commands, Copilot helped to ensure the "GameOver" Scene was not played by adding `@workspace Do not play GameOver Scene`.
3. **Code Edits**: Copilot assisted in recreating the game and stars game from the tutorial, as well as fixing physics errors.
4. **Platform Addition**: It helped in adding platforms similar to those in the tutorial.
5. **Character Mechanics**: Copilot enabled Dude to walk and jump as demonstrated in the tutorial.
6. **Asset Integration**: The image for the bomb was sourced from phaser.io's shiny ball, as suggested by Copilot.

These contributions made the development process smoother and more efficient.
